This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle “House Prices – Advanced Regression Techniques” challenge. The goal of this competition is to predict the final sale price of residential homes using various explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of the house.

## Data Preparation

* Performed data cleaning and normalization to ensure consistency.
* Applied feature engineering to extract and transform meaningful variables.
* Handled missing values and outliers to improve model robustness.

## Modeling  
Implemented and tuned several regression models, including:
* Boosting models: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Random Forest
* Regularized regressions: Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net
  
Final predictions were obtained using ensemble learning by averaging tuned models, achieving improved generalization and performance.
